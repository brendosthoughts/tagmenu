		Here at Mind-Knowledge.com I believe that the world's a strange awe inspiring crazy place, and the best way you can help make it better is learn , and pass on your knowledge. 
		With that said there's a lot of places in the world that with for a lack of a better term are fucked up! If you have some extra cash helping people less fortunate then you is pretty honourable in are books. 
		Whether you choose to donate your time or resource's closer to home or further away we respect that. Here are a list of companies we think are doing some of the best and most innovative work in some of the worst are ont his rock we've named earth.

	<p>We are not saying that charity is the only way to improve the world, not being an asshole goes along way by itself, but if your looking to help some people out check out these great organizations. 
	<span>Please note that mind-knowledge.com is not in any way affiliated with any of these organisations , but merely think they're doing some awesome work!</span>
