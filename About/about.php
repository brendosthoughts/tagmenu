<h2>About</h2>
<p>
Mind-knowledge.com is a passionate project of mine. It is basically a collection of video that will make you think or realize things from another perspective.
The video's on here are aggregated from other sites around the web, mostly from youtube. All the videos on the site are either documentaries , talks from confrences or debates. Although I love podcasts and love things like the Joe rogan Experience,
 Dan Carlin's Hardcore History or TWIT. The website is an agrregate of mostly Documentaries and talks from places like ted or iqsquared and videocast or pocasts will not fit in this though they nicely complemented them and I highly recomend listening to some podcasts if you don't already </p>
 <h5>Advertising & Charities</h5>
 <p> 
 You may notice advertisement from adsense (google) which help support the hosting and my own efforts in the development of the site, if you have an interest in advertising on the site <a title="advertise with us" href="Advertise.php">Check out Advertising Here</a>. 
 You will also notice smaller advertisement for charities which are not paid for in any sense, these are just organsiations doing good things around the world and you can see all the chariteis over on the <a href="../SocialGood">Social Good page</a>.
  This is basically my attempt at extending these organization's reach. Any extra money after hosting will be given to a part of these charities as this site will not be a primary source of income for myself.
